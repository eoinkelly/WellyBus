# Welly Bus

A simple SwiftUI app that allows you get real time information about departures from some hard-coded bus stops for bus services in Wellington, New Zealand

> [!WARNING]
> This app is really only useful to people who are able to build their own iOS apps locally. All settings are hard-coded and this isn't in the app store. I'm making it public so other developers can maybe use it as a platform for building their own custom bus apps.
